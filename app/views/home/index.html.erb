  <p>Traveling is romanticized by almost everyone. It is the experience of enveloping ourselves in the places that we’ve only read about, and embracing the people who colored those stories. I love the photo above, partly for selfish reasons. It is a captivating picture of, well, me, and is taken by a great friend of mine. But I also love it because of the way that it demonstrates, for me, what so many adventurers whose words I have read meant when they wrote about the difference between being a traveler and a tourist. Not that there is anything wrong with tourism, it is efficient and enjoyable. But the difference between the two is that the tourist goes somewhere to see a site that he read about in a magazine, or to have an interesting thing be created for him.</p>
  <p>The traveler goes somewhere in search of nothing so particular, but simply adventure. He embeds himself in, and observes what is local, in search of the more raw experience. This picture was taken at the top of High-West peak on Hong Kong Island. My two friends and I made the hike to the top of it on a hot day for the sake of hiking. Now this was not such an adventurous journey— hiking is a pretty normal thing for a few exchange students to do on a Saturday in Hong Kong, but when we reached the top, covered in sweat and thirsty, the unexpected view right as the sunset approached was awe-inspiring. When a journey is taken for the sake of the journey itself, the fruit bore by that strenuous trip is much sweeter.</p>
  <p>Our satisfaction was heightened when we noticed that we could see Victoria Peak from where we stood. Victoria Peak is an excellent site in Hong Kong where tourists take a train to the top, and line up through a mall to gain access to a viewing deck where they push through each other for the iconic photo of the City and the harbor. The location makes for an awesome shot, but the experience cannot compare to standing in solitude, at what feels like the edge of the earth. It is with this idea of adventure, and of finding these pensive, remote corners of life in mind that I build this blog site.</p>
